## Responsibilities

Team members review pull requests, triage new issues, mentor new contributors,
and maintain the Twiggy project.

Larger, more nuanced decisions about design, architecture, breaking changes,
trade offs, etc are made by team consensus. In other words, decisions on things
that aren't straightforward improvements or bug fixes to things that already
exist in `twiggy`. If consensus can't be made, then `fitzgen` has the last
word.

**We need more team members!**
