# Code Formatting

We use [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt) to enforce a
consistent code style across the whole code base.

You can install the latest version of `rustfmt` with this command:

```
$ rustup update
$ rustup component add rustfmt-preview --toolchain nightly
```

Ensure that `~/.rustup/toolchains/$YOUR_HOST_TARGET/bin/` is on your `$PATH`.

Once that is taken care of, you can (re)format all code by running this command
from the root of the repository:

```
$ cargo +nightly fmt --all
```
