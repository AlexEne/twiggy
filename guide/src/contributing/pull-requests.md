# Pull Requests

All pull requests must be reviewed and approved of by at least one
[team](./team.html) member before merging. See [Contributions We
Want](#contributions-we-want) for details on what should be included in what
kind of pull request.

## Contributions We Want

* **Bug fixes!** Include a regression test.

* **Support for more binary formats!** See [this issue][more-formats] for
  details.

* **New analyses and queries!** Help expose information about monomorphizations
  or inlining. Report diffs between two versions of the same binary. Etc...

If you make two of these kinds of contributions, you should seriously consider
joining our [team](./team.html)!

## Where We Need Help

* Issues labeled ["help wanted"][help-wanted] are issues where we could use a
  little help from you.

* Issues labeled ["mentored"][mentored] are issues that don't really involve any
  more investigation, just implementation. We've outlined what needs to be done,
  and a [team](./team.html) member has volunteered to help whoever claims the
  issue to implement it, and get the implementation merged.

* Issues labeled ["good first issue"][gfi] are issues where fixing them would be
  a great introduction to the code base.
